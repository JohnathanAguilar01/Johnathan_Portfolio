            About Me
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg font-bold">
            I'm a senior at California State University, Northridge, where I've
            built a strong foundation in computer science, from data structures
            and algorithms to software engineering and operating systems. My
            academic journey has been enriched by a minor in data science,
            equipping me with essential skills in probability, statistical
            modeling, and machine learning. Alongside my studies, Iâ€™ve explored
            practical applications through personal projects in web development
            and database implementation using technologies like React, Node.js,
            Express.js, MySQL, and AWS.

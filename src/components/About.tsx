        I'm a senior at California State University, Northridge, where I've
        built a strong foundation in computer science, from data structures and
        algorithms to software engineering and operating systems. My academic
        journey has been enriched by a minor in data science, equipping me with
        essential skills in probability, statistical modeling, and machine
        learning. Alongside my studies, Iâ€™ve explored practical applications
        through personal projects in web development and database implementation
        using technologies like React, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, and AWS.
